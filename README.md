Typogrowth is the simple gem, providing easy way to make string
typographically correct. It introduce the class method:

    Typogrowth::Parser.parse string, lang = nil

as well as it monkeypatches `String` class with `typo` method.
If language is omitted, it uses `I18n.locale`. Also `:default`
may be specified as language setting (which is english, in fact.)

To modify the succession of quotation signs (as well as all the 
others options,) feel free to change `config/typogrowth.yaml`.
